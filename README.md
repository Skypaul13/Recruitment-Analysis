# Recruitment-Analysis
This project is about recruitment analysis and the different KPIs of the recruitment process.
Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard to track and analyze key recruitment KPIs, including:
âœ… Number of Applicants (1,730)
âœ… Hires vs. Open Positions (158 hires for 31 positions)
âœ… Hiring Efficiency (8.9%)
âœ… Candidate Source Effectiveness (Top sources: Employee Referrals, Naukri, LinkedIn)
âœ… Average Time-to-Hire (12â€“21 weeks across roles)
âœ… Recruitment Cost Analysis across portals (LinkedIn, Naukri, Monster, Indeed)

This dashboard not only provides a data-driven view of the recruitment funnel, but also helps HR leaders optimize sourcing channels, reduce hiring costs, and improve overall recruitment efficiency.

ðŸ“Š Data-driven hiring decisions = smarter workforce planning!
